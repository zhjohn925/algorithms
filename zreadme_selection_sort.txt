- Selection Sort
  Idea: works by repeatedly selecting the smallest in remaining items.
  1. First, find the smallest item in the array and exchange it with the first entry.
  2. Then, find the next smallest item and exchange it with the second entry.
  3. Continue in this way until the entire array is sorted.
  
- Selection sort uses ~ (N^2)/2 compares and N exchanges to sort an array of length N.
